      abstract = {Since health care on foods is drawing people's attention
          recently, in this paper we propose a computer vision based food
              recognition system could be used to estimate food for diabetes
              patients. This study proposes a methodology for automatic food
              recognition, based on the Bag of Features (BoF) model. We present
              an approach to find out the group and location of objects in
              images. The system computes dense local features using scale
              invariant features. It performs very fast classification of each
              pixel in an image. For the design and valuation of the proposed
              system, a image dataset with nearly 5010 food images was created
              and organized into 11 classes. This system has achieved the
              accuracy of 78%.of objects in images. The system computes dense
              local features using scale invariant features. It performs very
