Lightweight requirements elicitation was carried out for this FYP.
Since prototyping itself is an elicitation technique \parencite{reqs}, the requirements for this prototype application did not need to be extensive.
Myself and my supervisor acted as stakeholders for this project as users of the system.
Two methods of elicitation were used for this project sourced from \parencite{reqs}.
These elicitation techniques were data gathering from an existing system and brain storming.

In a previous FYP, a mobile application was developed for nutritional assessment.
The use of this application provided the opportunity to elicit requirements based on data gathered from this system. Brainstorming also took place between the stakeholders for requirements elicitation.

\tocless\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
The nature of a prototype application does not call for non-functional requirements.
Despite this some non-functional requirements were kept in mind during the development of this application such as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Performance - for example, how long it takes for an image to be classified.}
	\item{Extensibility - is it easy to extend the functionality of the system.}
	\item{Maintainability - how easy it is to maintain the system.}
	\item{Usability - how easy it is to use the system.}
\end{itemize}
