\chapter{Prototype Application}
\label{prototype}
In order to demonstrate practical use of the models trained in Chapter 4, a prototype application was developed.
This application was developed for a smartphone running on the Android operating system in the Java programming language.
A backend service was created to receive an image from the smartphone
application, process the image using the CNN previously developed and return a
response to the application in the form of a prediction.
