\subsection*{Overview}
In the preious experiments, I have looked at the one-shot approach to food image
classification. That is, the model will give a prediction of the most liekly
food item in that image. This is a problem when there are multiple food in an
image. There are a few options to combat this problem. Firstly, I could detect
objects in the image, segment the image according to these objects and then run
each segment through the model. A simple approach to this would be to segment
the image into a number of sections and then run each section through the model.
