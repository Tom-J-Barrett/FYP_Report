\tocless\subsection{Objective}
Within the retrain.py script \parencite{retrainInception}, as mentioned in
previous experiments, there are various parameters that can be set and changed.
Various combinations of these parameters were changed to see if it would increase the
test accuracy of the model.

\tocless\subsection{Script}
Script as seen in \ref{inception} but with some additions to calculate Top 5 accuracy as seen
in Figure \ref{lst:top5}.
Also documented is the code used to label a new image using the model (Figure \ref{lst:labelImage2}).

Figure \ref{lst:top5} takes 10 images for each class and runs each through the model.
The script then checks if the expected value is within the top 5 predictions returned from Figure \ref{lst:labelImage2}.
If it is the amount of correct top 5 predictions is incremented by one.
To calculate the Top-5 accuracy, the number of correct top-5 predictions is divided by the total number of images tested (10 images per class x number of classes) and multiplied by 100 for obtain a percentage value.

\tocless\subsection{Results}
The results of each set of parameters can be seen in Table
\ref{parameter_tuning_table}.
Using the parameters of 10,000 steps, and a learning rate of 0.1 and therefore a final test accuracy of 66.3\%, the model achieved a Top 5 accuracy of 85.96\%.
This Top-5 accuracy was calculated from 1090 images in the test dataset and the average probability of the predictions were at 0.62.
The 95\% confidence interval of the Top-1 accuracy of this model is between 57.4\% and 75.2\%.


\tocless\subsection{Analysis}
The set of parameters that seem to be the most
effective are 10,000 steps with a 0.1 learning rate. Graphs of this model can be
seen in Figures \ref{fig:model_train_val} and \ref{fig:model_train_test}. These
are based on the validation set and then the test set respectively. A side by
side comparison can also be seen in Figures \ref{fig:test_val_accuracy} and
\ref{fig:test_val_accuracy_refined} where orange is for during training and blue
for the validation set.

There were two separate factors that each increased classification accuracy of
about 5\% each. These were training steps and learning rate.

Training steps are related to the number of images so before, when the training
steps were at 4,000, not all of the training images were being used. As the steps were increased
twofold we saw a 3.8\% increase in accuracy.

Another parameter that increased accuracy significantly was learning rate. The
default learning rate is 0.01 which was increased to 0.1. This resulted in an
increase of 6.7\%. This is most likely since we are only
looking at the last layer, we can afford to change the weights more
significantly.

The Top 5 accuracy of the model was quite good but it was not run on the same number of images as the final test accuracy.
This is beacuse TensorFlow does not have an API for calculating Top 5 accuracy.
As a result, it had to be calculated manually and this is very time intensive.
The average probability of 0.62 is also quite close to the overall Top 1 accuracy which may imply some correlation between the two but this is merely speculation.
