\subsection*{Overview}
In our three previous sliding window oriented experiments, we had only used a
single image. In order to see whether this image had biases unknown
to us, I decided to use another fruit bowl image. This image was selected as
fruit took up a larger portion of the image as seen in Figure \ref{fig:newFruit}
