\section{Introduction to Machine Learning}
In \textcite{ML}, Machine Learning is defined as "the question of how to
construct computer programs that auotmatically improve with experience".

\section{Machine Learning Paradigms}
There are many Machine Learning paradigms, all of which I will
discuss briefly below, but the main area of my focus for this project is in
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). This is because I have researched extensively into ConvolutionalÂ Neural Networks which are based on ANN's.
\subsection{Artificial Neural Networks}
An Artificial Neural Network is a bio-inspired system that is used to model the human brain in how it learns from experience.

\subsubsection{Multi Layered Perceptron and Backpropogation}
\subsubsection{Convolutional Neural Networks}
Convolutional Neural Networks are esentially a Multi Layered Percetron with a
special stucture.
