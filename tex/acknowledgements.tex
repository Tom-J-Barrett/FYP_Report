\section*{Acknowledgements}
Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisor Mr. J.J. Collins for all the support and guidance over the course of this final year project.
I came to J.J. with the plan to centre my FYP around image recognition using convolutional neural networks.
J.J. provided me with an aim to recognise food images which was both a challenging and relevant topic.
Throughout the course of my FYP, J.J. was available to talk through any issues or queries in a helpful manner and alaways made time for me.
This project would not have been possible without him.

Secondly, I would like to thank my course director Dr. Norah Power.
Norah has always been open to giving me guidance and support during my time in UL, of which I am very grateful.
I would also thank Paddy Healy who succeeded Norah in my final year as my course director.

Many thanks are due to my family and friends who supported me during my time in college.
It would not have been possible to complete my degree without my parents Karen and Derek, my sister Kate and my girlfriend Lauren.

Special thanks to Miky, Robbie and PJ for all the projects that we worked on together and the good times that came with them.

Finally, I would to thank all of the CSIS staff especially Jim Buckely our FYP coordinator, for their support over my four years in UL.
