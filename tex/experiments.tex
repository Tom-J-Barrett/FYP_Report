\chapter{Introduction to Using Tensorflow}
The purpose of this chapter is to give an overview of what has been completed in order to gain understanding of how to create CNNs and also how to work with datasets. Three experiments are explored in this chapter, the first two of which are tutorials completed as an introduction to Tensorflow and CNNs. The final experiment explores how to feed datasets from file directories into CNNs.

\section{Template for Experiments}
The template followed for all experiments in chapters three, four and five is outlined in Figure \ref{fig:expTemplate}.

\begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{11cm}|}
Experiment Section   & Rationale                \\
Overview             & An explanation of the purpose of the experiment along with how it is carried out. \\
Network Architecture & An explanation of the network architecture used in the experiment. If the architecture has been explained in another experiment, the architecture will only be referenced by name.                       \\
Dataset              & The dataset used for the experiment, with its source and an overview of its details. A brief mention will be made in following experiments.                       \\
API's                & Reference to the technologies used as outlined in Chapter 2.                      \\
Script               & Snippets of the script used for the experiment.                       \\
Results              & The results acquired from the experiment, usually in the form of a percentage accuracy.                       \\
Empirical Analysis   & States any information gained from the experiment and speculation for the reasoning of the results.

\chapter{Training Using the Inception-V3 Model Architecture}
This chapter consists of experiments which train various Tensorflow models.
There are parameters that can be changed in the code that creates a Tensorflow model based on the Inception-V3 model architecture.
These parameters were changed in order to see how the model accuracy would be affected.
In addition to this, change in dataset size was explored in relation to model accuracy.
