\section{Template for Experiments}
The template followed for all experiments in chapters three, four and five is outlined in Figure \ref{fig:expTemplate}.

\begin{table}[]

\caption{Experiment Template}
\label{fig:expTemplate}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Experiment Section   & Rationale                \\
Overview             & An explanation of the purpose of the experiment along with how it is carried out. \\
Network Architecture & An explanation of the network architecture used in the experiment. If the architecture has been explained in another experiment, the architecture will only be referenced by name.                       \\
Dataset              & The dataset used for the experiment, with its source and an overview of its details. A brief mention will be made in following experiments.                       \\
API's                & Reference to the technologies used as outlined in Chapter 2.                      \\
Script               & Snippets of the script used for the experiment.                       \\
Results              & The results acquired from the experiment, usually in the form of a percentage accuracy.                       \\
Empirical Analysis   & States any information gained from the experiment and speculation for the reasoning of the results.
