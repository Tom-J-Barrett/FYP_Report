\section{Introduction to Machine Learning}
In \textcite{MLANN}, Machine Learning is defined as "the question of how to
construct computer programs that automatically improve with experience".
Machine Learning has blossomed in recent years with applications across multiple
domains using vastly different paradigms and technologies.

There are many ways in which Machine Learning can be used in the modern world,
many of which are being utilised to great affect.
Some of these applications, are image recognition, natural language
processing,
medical diagnosis and many more.
There may be fear that Machine Learning will start to take away many jobs
from
humans but this may not be the case. Imagine a doctor, having to diagnose a
patient, a machine can offer suggestions based on very large datasets of
what
the diagnosis is. This is not to say that a Machine would be
perscribing patients, but merely act as an assistant to the doctor.

Machine Ethics is a large problem that comes hand in hand with Machine
Learning.
There is a very important question of who takes the blame when things go
wrong,
that is why I think it is important that we only use Machine Learning to
advise
and not to determine but this can be very difficult in a world where, for
example, an autonomous car has to decide between crashing into a vehicle
beside
them with an unknown number of people inside or the two children playing in
the street.

One of the most exciting avenues in Machine Learning, in my opinion, is
Computer
Vision. Computer Vision can be used in many areas to improve our lives. As
mentioned earlier, autonomous cars are only possible when a machine can
determine what objects are around it. Computer Vision can allow a machine to
recognise skin diseases in an image. The applications are nearly limitless
and
that is without taking into account other uses.
