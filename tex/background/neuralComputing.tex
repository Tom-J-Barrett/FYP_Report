\section{Neural Computing}
The main area of my focus for this project is in
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). This is because extensive research has been carried out into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which are based on ANNs.
\subsection*{Artificial Neural Networks}
An Artificial Neural Network is a bio-inspired system that is used to model the human brain in how it learns from experience.
The ANN uses this model to build a very complex web of connected units called
artificial neurons.
These neurons are connected by certain weights which determines the processing
capacity of the network and these weights are created by learning a
dataset.(reference Malachy)
An ANN has a set of inputs that take in a value, sometimes from network outputs
and produce a single result or classification.
While an ANN is bio-inspired from the human brain, there are many elements of
the brain that are not present in ANN and many new elements in ANN that are not
modeled from the human brain.

Before Convolution Neural Networks can be explored, which are vital to image
processing, the perceptron learning algorithm, the multi
layer perceptron, backpropogation must be analysed.
