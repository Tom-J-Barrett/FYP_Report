\section{Neural Computing}
The main area of my focus for this project is in
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). This is because I have researched extensively into Convolutional Neural Networks which are based on ANN's.
\subsection*{Artificial Neural Networks}
An Artificial Neural Network is a bio-inspired system that is used to model the human brain in how it learns from experience.
The ANN uses this model to build a very complex web of connected units called
artificial neurons.
These nuerons are connected by certain weights which determines the processing
capacity of the network and these weights are created by learning a
dataset.(Malachy)
An ANN has a set of inputs that take in a value, sometimes from network outputs
and produce a single result or classification.
While an ANN is bio-inspired from the human brain, there are many elements of
the brain that are not present in ANN and many new elements in ANN that are not
modelled from the human brain.

Before I can talk about Convolution Neural Networks which are vital the image
processing, I will have to talk about the perceptron learning algorithm, the multi
layer percepton, and backpropogation.
