There has been a very interesting paper from UC Berkeley focused on using Full Convolutional
Networks for semantic segmentation \textcite{fcn}. Fully Convolutional Networks
do not have any fully connected layers. They are replaced with more filtering
layers. Nvidia Digits have a semantic segmentation implementation based off the
work of this paper.

They took this approach because "feedforward computation and backpropogation are
much more efficient when computer layer-by-layer over an entire image instead of
independently patch-by-patch" \textcite{fcn}.
