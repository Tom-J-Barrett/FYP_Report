Ross Girshik and other contributers had some very positive results in the area
of object detection using region based convolutional neural networks. There were
four iterations of papers based on this work by Ross and groups in UC Berkley,
Mircosoft and Facebook. A PHD student at the time of Ross's first paper also
completed his dissertation on the subject. I will analyse this papers, their
results and the changes made through each iteration.

\subsubsection{RCNN}
In the first paper written by Ross Girshik focused on two main insights. These
were that "one can apply high-capacity concolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects" and that
"when training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for n auxilary task,
followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost"
