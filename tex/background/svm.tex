\section{Support Vector Machine}
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm that has been
very popular before the use of a CNN was mainstream.

A SVM works by creating an n-dimensional space, with n as the number of
inputs you have \textcite{svm}. The SVM algorithm finds the hyperplane that splits this space.
This hyperplane can then be used for classification. 
An SVM casts the problem to a higher dimensional space and this can solve a problem when the classes are not linearly separable.
This can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:svm}, where on the left there is no clear way to separate the classes but once the problem is cast to another dimensional, the separation is clear.

There are benefits and liabilities to using a SVM.
They can be very accurate and can work efficiently with small datasets but unfortunately it can take a large amount of time to train.
