\section{Support Vector Machine}
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm that has been
very popular before the power of a CNN was realised.

A SVM works by creating an n-dimensional space, with n as the number of
inputs you have \textcite{svm}. The SVM algorithm finds the hyperplane that splits this space.
This hyperplane can then be used for classification.
